# 🌫️ AI-Powered Image Dehazing Using Dark Channel Prior

A real-time image enhancement web application built using **Flask** and **OpenCV**, powered by the **Dark Channel Prior (DCP)** algorithm with adaptive AI logic. This tool removes haze from outdoor images — ideal for **surveillance**, **autonomous vehicles**, **remote sensing**, and **image clarity restoration**.

---

## ✨ Project Highlights

- 🔍 Classifies images into **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** haze levels
- 🌫️ Uses **Dark Channel Prior** and **Guided Filtering** for accurate haze removal
- 🤖 Adaptive parameter tuning based on haze intensity
- ⚡ Real-time image upload, dehazing, comparison, and download
- 🎨 Color enhancement using **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)

---

## 🖼️ Key Features

- Upload hazy images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`)
- Automatic haze level detection & dehazing
- View **original vs dehazed** image side-by-side
- Download the enhanced, haze-free image

## ✅ Test Cases Covered

- ✅ Upload and dehaze valid image files
- ❌ Upload non-image file → shows appropriate error
- ⚠️ Missing file upload → shows error
- 🕓 Performance tested with large-resolution images
- 🔄 Supports multiple formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`
- 📥 Allows dehazed image download after processing

---

## 🧠 Core Algorithm: Dark Channel Prior (DCP)

1. Estimate the **dark channel** of the image
2. Detect **brightest pixels** to estimate **atmospheric light**
3. Compute and refine the **transmission map**
4. Reconstruct the **haze-free image**
5. Apply **CLAHE** to improve visibility and colors

---

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- 🖼️ Batch image dehazing support
- 🎞️ Real-time **video dehazing** (frame-by-frame)
- ☁️ Deploy to cloud (PythonAnywhere, Render, etc.)
- 🧠 Use **deep learning (CNN)** for intelligent haze detection and removal
